ResourceBootstrapper
====================

#### Overview

The resource bootstrapper aims at keeping 3rd party references in check. This allows the 3rd party reference to be loaded in such a way that it doesn't affect the user's experience with the site even if there is an issue with the 3rd party script or getting to that script.
